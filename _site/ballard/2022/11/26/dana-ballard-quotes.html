    <p>I took a class during my last semester at UT Austin called “Computational Brain”, thinking that knowing a little bit of computational neuroscience would allow be to tie some ounce of legitimacy to any ideas about the brain I spouted off later in my life. I figured that if I ever got a model to work, I would be able to point to some similar mechanism in the brain, and then say something along the lines of “Look! It’s biologically-motivated!”.</p>

<p>Rather, I ended up in a class with one of the funniest professors I’ve ever sat in with: Dr. Dana Ballard. I loved going to that class, and while I was in it I wrote down the funniest bits and pieces that he uttered, because I thought he was hilarious. Now he’s gone. I’m sure he’ll be remembered for his research and academic legacy, of which I know very little, but I’ll remember him for his great sense of humor and great lectures.</p>

<p>Anyways, here’s the quote list I saved:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I used to go on a lot of dates when I was younger. I wanted to show off, so I just hoped they’d ask a question about the brain I could answer.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Running is like drugs. Half hour in, the chemicals hit, and you’re just gone.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Are you married? No? Then learn to dance. It’ll help you.”</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Student: “Do you dance?”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>“No, but my wife does.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I’m not trying to get you kids married but you sure need help.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“If you can’t understand women, you’ll spend your life walking the streets crying.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“You eat healthy? In Texas? Have you ever had a ribeye steak? No?!? Oh, what a shame.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The dean told me to not talk about politics in my classes because I’m old.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“If I were in hell they’d make me golf.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Well, sharks don’t own property, so I don’t think they’re very smart.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“It’s Miller time!”</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Class is in silence</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>“…you know, like a beer. It’s time for a beer. Because class is over. That’s your cue class is over. Go drink something like a college student.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Instead of Miller time, do you all do marijuana instead? Maybe I should end class with marijuana time.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“It’s common for children to go through an autistic period around 3 years old and grow out of it”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“This was published by German scientists in 1944. It’s really nice, considering that.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Starbucks time! That’s what I can use.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Student: “Will a different TA grade my papers?”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>“Why, do you plan to bribe them?”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I used to go on airplanes and have a competition to get drunk as fast as I could.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“My first job out of college was to test airplane engines. When there was a result that was deemed unsafe I was in charge of erasing the result. A bit of that and I decided… graduate school. No more industry.”</p>
</blockquote>
