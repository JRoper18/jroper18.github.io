I'm currently a Software Engineer at Kalshi working on DevOps and distributed systems while living in Brooklyn. I graduated from UT Austin with a BS in Computer Science in May 2022. I graduated with Turing Honors, which included my undergraduate thesis on [program synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.09246). I've also been published in [bioinformatics and graph neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.10540). I've previously worked for Amazon, PIMCO, and the AbbVie Innovation Center. I'm also a [Neo Scholar](https://neo.com/people). I'm confident that new programming languages and paradigms are needed to enable better distributed systems programming and neurosymbolic programming. 

I really enjoy science fiction and fantasy books. I like to run, and I'm trying to learn how to rock climb, but I'm absolutely terrible. If it's late out and I see Orion in the sky I'll point it out, but I don't know any other constellations. I've failed to get short stories published, so I figure that makes me qualified to review them. I use this blog to post bad takes, most of which have nearly nothing to do with my research or professional life. The best way to reach me is by [email](mailto:jackroper18@gmail.com).
