Preface: I don't actually know if Worm, written by wildbow, fits the legal definition of "book". The word I always hear used is "web-serial", being that the entire series has no (as far as I can tell) physical edition, and that it's [published entirely online for anyone to read](https://parahumans.wordpress.com/). Still, I want to review it, and it's content is entirely text, so I'll call it a book review. 


Today, the superhero genre absolutely *dominates* culture, with [five of the top ten grossing movies being Marvel films](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/chart/top_lifetime_gross/?area=XWW) and One Punch Man and My Hero Academia ranking as the 4th and 6th (respectively) most popular franchises on [MyAnimeList](https://myanimelist.net/topanime.php?type=bypopularity) at the time of writing. 

I won't spent more time emphasizing the superhero genre. But I will, hopefully, shed light on what I consider to be a highly under-appreciated part of it: Worm, a web serial written incrementally from 2011 to 2013, totalling ~1,680,000 words (although for web fiction, [length doesn't tend to correlate with quality](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4112682/1/The-Subspace-Emissary-s-Worlds-Conquest)). 


It follows Taylor Herbert, an angsty teenager who learns she can control bugs but also gets bullied in high school. Yes, this premise *reeks* of young adult fiction of the 2010s/late 2000s. It smells of bad Twilight inspired teenaged romance, and you would expect this story to be slathered with the Harry Potter inspired belief that every story is better when it takes place within a school.
