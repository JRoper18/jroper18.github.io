I'm currently a Software Enginner at Kalshi, living in Brooklyn. I graduated from UT Austin in 2022 with Turing Honors, after doing my undergraduate thesis on [program synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.09246). I've also done research in [bioinformatics and graph neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.10540). I've previously worked for PIMCO, Amazon, and AbbVie Innovation Center. I'm also a [Neo Scholar](https://neo.com/people). I read stuff and post bad takes, most of which have nearly nothing to do with my research or professional life. The best way to reach me is by [email](mailto:jackroper18@gmail.com).
