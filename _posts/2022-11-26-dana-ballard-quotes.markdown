I took a class during my last semester at UT Austin called "Computational Brain", thinking that knowing a little bit of computational neuroscience would allow be to tie some ounce of legitimacy to any ideas about the brain I spouted off later in my life. I figured that if I ever got a model to work, I would be able to point to some similar mechanism in the brain, and then say something along the lines of "Look! It's biologically-motivated!". 

Rather, I ended up in a class with one of the funniest professors I've ever sat in with: Dr. Dana Ballard. I loved going to that class, and while I was in it I wrote down the funniest bits and pieces that he uttered, because I thought he was hilarious. Now he's gone. I'm sure he'll be remembered for his research and academic legacy, of which I know very little, but I'll remember him for his great sense of humor and great lectures. 

Anyways, here's the quote list I saved: 


> "I used to go on a lot of dates when I was younger. I wanted to show off, so I just hoped they'd ask a question about the brain I could answer."

> "Running is like drugs. Half hour in, the chemicals hit, and you're just gone."

> "Are you married? No? Then learn to dance. It'll help you."
> 
> > Student: "Do you dance?"
> 
> "No, but my wife does."

> "I'm not trying to get you kids married but you sure need help."

> "If you can't understand women, you'll spend your life walking the streets crying."

> "You eat healthy? In Texas? Have you ever had a ribeye steak? No?!? Oh, what a shame."

> "The dean told me to not talk about politics in my classes because I'm old."

> "If I were in hell they'd make me golf."

> "Well, sharks don't own property, so I don't think they're very smart."

> "It's Miller time!"
> 
> > Class is in silence
> 
> "...you know, like a beer. It's time for a beer. Because class is over. That's your cue class is over. Go drink something like a college student."

> "Instead of Miller time, do you all do marijuana instead? Maybe I should end class with marijuana time."

> "It's common for children to go through an autistic period around 3 years old and grow out of it"

> "This was published by German scientists in 1944. It's really nice, considering that."

> "Starbucks time! That's what I can use."

> > Student: “Will a different TA grade my papers?" 
> 
> “Why, do you plan to bribe them?"

> "I used to go on airplanes and have a competition to get drunk as fast as I could."

> "My first job out of college was to test airplane engines. When there was a result that was deemed unsafe I was in charge of erasing the result. A bit of that and I decided... graduate school. No more industry."
